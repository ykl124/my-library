## 1-2月📚《Lean in》

理由：为什么选这本书呢？1是因为朋友推荐，2是因为我是女生，强烈建议所有女性必看此书。
Chapter1 摘录：
> A guest asked her how American women could help those who experienced the horrors and mass rapes of war in places like Liberia. Her response was four simple words: “More women in power.”

> A 2011 McKinsey report noted that men are promoted based on potential, while women are promoted based on past accomplishments.

> Whatever this book is, I am writing it for any woman who wants to increase her chances of making it to the top of her field or pursue any goal vigorously.
